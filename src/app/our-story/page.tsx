      "OJARA takes its name from Ojas — the ancient Sanskrit word for vital essence, the subtle energy said to be the foundation of vitality, radiance, and inner strength.",
      "We built this house around a single belief: that the objects we keep closest shape the energy we carry. A stone on your desk, a talisman by your door, a crystal held in the palm — small, deliberate anchors for the life you intend.",

      "Every crystal begins deep in the earth, and we honour that origin. We work only with trusted partners who practise fair, responsible mining — protecting the land, the communities, and the hands that bring each stone to the surface.",
      "Nothing is mass-produced. Pieces are chosen one at a time for their clarity, colour, and quiet character, then authenticated before they ever reach our studio.",

      "Before a piece leaves us, it is cleared of residual energy and set with intention — through sage smoke, sound, and moonlight. It arrives not as a product, but as a companion ready to begin its work with you.",
      "This is the difference we obsess over: an object that feels held before it ever reaches your hands.",
